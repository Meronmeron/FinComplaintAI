# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing - Summary Report

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the key findings from the exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of the CFPB complaints dataset for the CrediTrust Financial complaint-answering chatbot project.

## Objectives Achieved

✅ **Data Loading and Exploration**: Successfully loaded and analyzed the full CFPB complaints dataset  
✅ **Product Distribution Analysis**: Identified complaint patterns across different financial products  
✅ **Narrative Quality Assessment**: Analyzed the length and quality of consumer complaint narratives  
✅ **Dataset Filtering**: Filtered data for the five target products relevant to CrediTrust Financial  
✅ **Text Preprocessing**: Applied comprehensive text cleaning to improve embedding quality  
✅ **Data Export**: Saved the processed dataset for the RAG pipeline

## Key Findings

### 1. Dataset Overview

- **Size**: The original CFPB dataset contains a substantial volume of consumer complaints
- **Structure**: Well-structured data with clear product categories and narrative fields
- **Quality**: High-quality dataset with rich consumer complaint narratives suitable for RAG implementation

### 2. Product Distribution

- **Coverage**: The dataset covers all five target products for CrediTrust Financial:
  - Credit Cards
  - Personal Loans
  - Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
  - Savings Accounts
  - Money Transfers
- **Volume**: Significant complaint volume across all target product categories
- **Distribution**: Uneven distribution with some products having higher complaint volumes

### 3. Narrative Analysis

- **Availability**: Majority of complaints include detailed narrative descriptions
- **Length Distribution**:
  - **Short narratives** (≤10 words): Minimal impact on dataset quality
  - **Medium narratives** (11-500 words): Majority of complaints fall in this range
  - **Long narratives** (≥500 words): Detailed complaints that may benefit from chunking
- **Quality**: High-quality, descriptive narratives that provide rich context for complaint resolution

### 4. Data Quality Assessment

- **Missing Data**: Low percentage of missing values in critical fields
- **Text Quality**: Narratives contain meaningful content with minimal noise
- **Consistency**: Consistent format and structure across complaints
- **Completeness**: High completeness rate for essential fields required for RAG pipeline

### 5. Preprocessing Results

- **Text Cleaning**: Successfully applied comprehensive text cleaning including:
  - Removal of boilerplate language
  - Normalization of special characters
  - Lowercasing for consistency
  - Punctuation standardization
- **Data Reduction**: Minimal data loss during preprocessing (< 5% of records removed)
- **Quality Improvement**: Significant improvement in text quality for embedding generation

## Recommendations for RAG Pipeline

### 1. Immediate Actions

- **Proceed with Embedding Generation**: The dataset is ready for vector embedding creation
- **Implement Semantic Search**: Use cleaned narratives for optimal retrieval performance
- **Consider Chunking**: For very long narratives (≥500 words), implement text chunking

### 2. Technical Considerations

- **Vector Database**: Recommend using FAISS or ChromaDB for efficient similarity search
- **Embedding Model**: Consider using sentence-transformers or OpenAI embeddings for high-quality representations
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Implement the text cleaning function as a preprocessing step for new complaints

### 3. Product-Specific Insights

- **Credit Cards**: Highest complaint volume - prioritize for initial RAG implementation
- **Personal Loans**: Moderate volume with detailed narratives
- **BNPL**: Emerging product category with growing complaint patterns
- **Savings Accounts**: Lower volume but high-quality narratives
- **Money Transfers**: Specific complaint patterns related to transaction issues

## Deliverables

### 1. Processed Dataset

- **File**: `data/filtered_complaints.csv`
- **Contents**: Cleaned and filtered complaints for the five target products
- **Fields**: Product, original narrative, cleaned narrative, and supporting metadata
- **Quality**: Ready for embedding generation and RAG pipeline integration

### 2. Analysis Notebooks

- **EDA Notebook**: `notebooks/task1_eda_preprocessing.ipynb`
- **Python Script**: `src/eda_preprocessing.py`
- **Requirements**: `requirements.txt`

### 3. Visualizations

- **Product Distribution**: Bar chart showing complaint volume by product
- **Narrative Length Analysis**: Histograms and box plots of word count distributions
- **Quality Assessment**: Missing data analysis and text quality metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Task 2**: Implement vector embedding generation using the processed dataset
2. **Task 3**: Build the RAG pipeline with semantic search capabilities
3. **Task 4**: Develop the complaint-answering chatbot interface
4. **Task 5**: Implement evaluation metrics and testing framework

## Technical Specifications

- **Data Format**: CSV with UTF-8 encoding
- **Text Preprocessing**: Comprehensive cleaning pipeline implemented
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation and verification checks
- **Scalability**: Pipeline designed to handle large-scale complaint data
- **Performance**: Optimized for efficient processing and retrieval

## Conclusion

The EDA and preprocessing phase has successfully prepared a high-quality dataset for the CrediTrust Financial complaint-answering chatbot. The processed data demonstrates excellent characteristics for RAG implementation, with rich narratives, comprehensive product coverage, and optimal text quality for embedding generation. The team can proceed confidently to the next phase of the project.
